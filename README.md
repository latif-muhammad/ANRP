This project is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system built using Python, OpenCV, EasyOCR, and Django. It allows for the detection, extraction, and recognition of vehicle number plates from images or video streams.

## Features

- Vehicle number plate detection and extraction using computer vision techniques with OpenCV.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for number plate recognition using EasyOCR.
- Support for processing images.
- User-friendly web interface built with Django and HTML for easy interaction with the ANPR system.
- Storage and retrieval of processed number plate data using a backend database.

## Prerequisites

To run the ANPR system, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- EasyOCR library
- Django framework


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
